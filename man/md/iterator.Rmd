An r-lib iterator is a function that implements the following protocol:

- Calling the function advances the iterator. The new value is returned.

- When the iterator is exhausted and there are no more elements to return, the symbol `quote(exhausted)` is returned. This signals exhaustion to the caller.

- Once an iterator has signalled exhaustion, all subsequent invokations must consistently return `quote(exhausted)`.
