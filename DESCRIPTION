Description: Provides 'coroutines' for R, a family of functions that
    can be suspended and resumed later on. This includes generators
    (which yield) and 'async' functions (which await). The 'coro'
    package defines an iteration protocol for generator functions and
    provides a set of tools for iteration. The 'async/await' functions
    are based on the concurrency framework of the 'promises' package.
